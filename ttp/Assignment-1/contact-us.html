    <h3>Ecuador's less fortunate children do not receive the medical care they need, because adequate medical resources are not available in the areas where they live. Furthermore, the lack of social protection makes it impossible for poor children to have operations that they need to be able to simply walk, see or hear.
        Volunteers from all over the world come to Ecuador to help give these children the opportunity to live a happier, more productive and fulfilling life, contributing to society in a positive way.
        Although the Foundation's headquarters are in Guayaquil, the doctors donate their time to carry out Medical Missions throughout the country. These missions take weeks planned and sometimes a year in advance, bringing in doctors, surgeons, translators, and other volunteers over a period of time. specified.</h3><br>
